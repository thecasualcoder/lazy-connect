### Usage

```
lazy-connect - Shell function to fuzzy search an IPSec VPN by name
               and connect to it automatically.

-i    - Initialize lazy-connect.
        Stores the secret and VPN list to ~/.config/lazy-connect/
-r    - refresh vpn list in ~/.config/lazy-connect
-a    - Connect to all VPNs  
-h    - Show this help
```

### YubiKey Support

#### Prerequisite

1. [yubikey-manager](https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-manager)

To use `TOTP` from YubiKey set the following environment variable

```sh
export LAZY_CONNECT_TOTP_GENERATOR=yubikey
export LAZY_CONNECT_TOTP_QUERY=<name of the issuer>
```

### Warning

- The secret key to generate TOTP is stored as plain text in `~/.config/lazy-connect/secret`
- You need to add your Termainal emulator app that invokes the function to `Security & Privacy -> Accessibility`. It is
  necesssary because the script interacts with the UI. There are other ways via CLI to avoid UI interaction but
  they are all broken in OS X 10.12+.
